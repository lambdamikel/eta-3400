# 3D Printed Case

Makes extensive use of heat-set threadserts to connect the pieces together. Double-faced tape is used to stick
some mounts onto the bottom of the trainer, and then magnets are used to attach the case to the mounts. This
makes the case easily removable (my youtube video ought to give a reasonable idea on how the case snaps on
and off).

Here is a list of hardware necessary to complete the case:

* Magnets - use 10mm x 3mm, commonly available on Amazon
* M2.5 machine screws - Usually a small assortment from Amazon will yield a variety of acceptable sizes
* 2.5mm heat-set thread inserts - I usually get these on eBay under the auction description "Qty 100 M2.5 2.5mm M2.5-0.45 Brass Threaded Heat Set Screw Inserts - 3D Printing"

Print the following:

* (1) eta-3400-front.stl - front panel
* (2) eta-3400-side.stl - sides
* (1) eta-3400-back.stl - back panel
* (1) eta-3400-tray.stl - attaches to the back panel and holds the PCB
* (1) eta-3400-base.stl - attachs between the tray and the front panel, providing additional rigidity
* (2) eta-3400-mount.stl - sticks to the trainer with double-faced tape
