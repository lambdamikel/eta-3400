This directory holds gerbers that can be used to fabricate the pcboards.

A few different ET-3400 related projects are in here

v0.10 and v0.9 hold the gerbers for the ETA-3400 memory/io board. v0.10 is the latest.

et-3400-6809-v0.2 holds gerbers for my clone for the 6809 adapter. This adapter is a separate project
and is not needed to build the memory/io accessory.
